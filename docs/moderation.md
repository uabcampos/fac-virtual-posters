# Moderation & Administration Guide

The FAC Virtual Poster session includes an administrative dashboard for managing submissions and community conversations.

## Accessing the Dashboard
The admin dashboard is available at:
`[Base URL]/admin`

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you are authorized to access this route. In the current development phase, this route is accessible for demonstration and debugging.

## Comment Moderation
The dashboard provides a **Recent Comments** section where you can:
1.  **Review Content**: View the author, timestamp, and content of all recent posts.
2.  **Navigate to Source**: Click the poster title to view the comment in its original context.
3.  **Delete Comments**: Click the trash icon (`Trash2`) to permanently remove inappropriate or off-topic content.

## Poster Management
The dashboard tracks the status of all posters:
- **Pending Review**: New submissions awaiting approval.
- **Published**: Posters currently visible in the gallery and hall.
- **Rejected / Drafts**: Content that has been hidden or is still being drafted.

## Best Practices
- **Scholar Interactions**: Use "Scholar Mode" on the poster pages to provide official research answers. These will be highlighted with a blue "Scholar Answer" badge.
- **Anonymous Posts**: If a post is anonymous but provides valuable feedback, it is often best to keep it. Only delete content that is disrespectful or irrelevant.
