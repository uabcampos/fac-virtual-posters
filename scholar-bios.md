Jennifer Caldwell, Ph.D., MPH

Jennifer Caldwell is a geneticist and public health researcher serving as an assistant professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center (LSU) ￼. As a Forge AHEAD pilot awardee, she leads the Linking GAINS project, which bridges the gap between research and real-world solutions by examining how ancestry, culture, and behavior influence health outcomes in communities with limited access to healthy food ￼.

Licy L. Yanes Cardozo, M.D.

Licy L. Yanes Cardozo is an associate professor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center delving into the connection between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and cardiovascular disease ￼. Her project investigates how social determinants of health contribute to cardiovascular risk factors in Black women with PCOS, correlating these factors with hormonal imbalances and blood pressure regulation to explain disparities in heart health ￼.

Stephen Clarkson, M.D., MSPH

Stephen Clarkson is a Forge AHEAD Center scholar and cardiologist at UAB whose work examines how social determinants of health impact heart failure care in underserved populations ￼. An assistant professor in cardiovascular medicine, he is leading a pilot study to implement screening tools and improve follow-up care for heart failure patients in a clinic serving vulnerable communities, aiming to reduce disparities in outcomes ￼ ￼.

Kaylee B. Crockett, Ph.D.

Kaylee Crockett is an assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UAB and a Forge AHEAD scholar working to improve cardiovascular health ￼. She leads the innovative Heart Care Pairs program, a dyadic intervention that pairs patients with hypertension and their supportive partners to build healthy habits together, demonstrating how team-based approaches can lead to better heart health and lasting lifestyle changes ￼.

Shena Gazaway, Ph.D., RN

Shena Gazaway is an assistant professor in the UAB School of Nursing whose work empowers high-risk chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their caregivers ￼. Through her Forge AHEAD project “ImPART,” she explores strategies to improve two-way communication and engagement in care, helping patients with uncontrolled blood pressure or diabetes take ownership of their medical journey and slow CKD progression ￼.

Donald (“Donny”) Gerke, Ph.D., MSW

Donny Gerke is an assistant professor in the Department of Social Work at UAB whose research addresses the intersection of homelessness and health ￼. He is investigating how stable housing programs (like HOPWA) influence HIV treatment and cardiometabolic outcomes in people living with HIV, evaluating whether housing support improves viral suppression, medication adherence, and overall health in this population ￼ ￼.

Lama Ghazi, M.D., Ph.D.

Lama Ghazi is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham leading a pilot telehealth initiative to improve hypertension care ￼. Her Forge AHEAD project implements a post-emergency department follow-up program for patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure, using telemedicine to ensure they receive timely support and management after hospital visits ￼. The goal is to prevent lapses in care and better control hypertension in vulnerable patients.

Ronnie “Matt” Gravett, M.D., MSPH

Ronnie “Matt” Gravett is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at UAB, focused on expanding HIV prevention in non-traditional settings ￼. His Forge AHEAD pilot project aims to integrate PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV) into urgent care clinics, “Laying the Foundation for PrEP in Urgent Care Settings,” to improve access to HIV preventive care without adding burden on patients or overtaxing specialized clinics ￼ ￼.

Cynthia Karlson, Ph.D.

Cynthia Karlson is vice chair of Pediatric Research at UMMC (University of Mississippi Medical Center) and a pediatric psychologist leading a study to promote wellness in adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease ￼. She directs the Sickle Cell FIT program, which tests the feasibility of strength-training and aerobic exercise for youth with SCD to improve fitness and prevent future cardiometabolic complications, while also identifying barriers to physical activity (like poverty and access to care) in this vulnerable group ￼ ￼.

Yulia Khodneva, M.D., Ph.D.

Yulia Khodneva is an internist and assistant professor of medicine at UAB who is spearheading a patient-centered intervention to improve heart failure care. As a Forge AHEAD scholar, she leads a pilot study to enhance patient education and self-management for individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) ￼. By involving patients and community partners, her project seeks to increase understanding of HFpEF and ensure better follow-up and management for these patients in primary care settings ￼.

Amber W. Kinsey, Ph.D.

Amber Kinsey is an assistant professor in the Division of Preventive Medicine at UAB whose research optimizes lifestyle interventions for cardiometabolic health in priority populations ￼. She focuses on making physical activity accessible and engaging — for example, introducing “exercise snacks” (brief bursts of activity) and tailored resistance training — to empower underrepresented groups to stay active and improve their health in ways that fit their daily lives ￼.

Byron Lai, Ph.D.

Byron Lai is an assistant professor in the Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine at UAB, exploring innovative ways to help children with disabilities stay healthy ￼. He is testing a virtual reality exercise program that turns rehab exercises into video games, aiming to improve fitness and prevent cardiometabolic problems in youth with physical disabilities. This community-engaged pilot in a school setting will evaluate whether VR gaming can make exercise more enjoyable and effective for children with special needs ￼ ￼.

Candice A. Myers, Ph.D.

Candice Myers is an assistant professor of Population and Public Health Sciences at LSU’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center and director of the Social Determinants and Health Disparities Laboratory ￼. She is pioneering a Forge AHEAD project to support women who face the dual challenges of food insecurity and obesity, by testing a tailored weight-loss intervention in food-insecure women ￼. This TARGET trial addresses how lack of access to healthy food contributes to chronic disease, aiming to mitigate that disparity and improve participants’ health outcomes ￼.

Camille Worthington, Ph.D., RDN, LDN

Camille Worthington is an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at UAB leading a groundbreaking nutrition initiative to improve maternal health ￼. Her project provides Medicaid-eligible pregnant women with healthy home-delivered meals, with the goal of promoting proper nutrition, healthy pregnancy weight gain, and better birth outcomes ￼. By addressing food access and diet quality during pregnancy, Worthington’s work strives to reduce complications like high blood pressure and support healthier moms and babies in vulnerable communities ￼.

Rongbing Xie, DrPH, MPH (Study on Recruitment & Retention)

Rongbing “Bing” Xie is an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at UAB working to bridge the gap between academic research and community health ￼ ￼. He is developing more effective strategies for recruiting and retaining underserved populations in research—specifically Black women living with HIV—by identifying barriers and facilitators to participation in health studies ￼. Through community-engaged approaches, Xie’s work seeks to build trust and make research more inclusive and reflective of the communities it serves.

Rongbing Xie, DrPH, MPH (Study on Diet & Exercise)

In another Forge AHEAD project, Dr. Xie is addressing cardiometabolic wellness in people living with HIV by focusing on diet and exercise behaviors. He is conducting a study to develop strategies for improving nutrition and physical activity in this group, guided by an assessment of multi-level social determinants of health ￼. This work offers a roadmap for making cardiometabolic health promotion more accessible and tailored to individuals’ lived experiences, ensuring that interventions meet people where they are and account for factors like caregiving responsibilities, transportation, and social context ￼.
